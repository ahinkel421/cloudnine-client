## CloudNine 

CloudNine is a safe space where people can come together and share positive experiences, inspirational quotes, or anything that will boost the morale of others. 



## Summary

Upon visiting the landing page, users will be welcomed with the slogan "Positive mind. Positive life." This encompasses what Cloudnine stands for and sets the tone for the remainder of the user's experience. In the middle of the page is a brief description of the app and how it should be used. The final section of the landing page has a list of the lounges that the user can visit. Depending on which lounge they choose, users can post about various topics such as personal achievements, inspirational quotes and random acts of kindness (more lounges coming soon).

Let's take a look at the Inspirational Quotes lounge. Similar to the landing page, our user is welcomed with a nice picture, header, and description representing the specific lounge. In the main section of the page is a modal that displays what other users have posted. If a user sees any negative content posted that they find offensive, they can click the "report as innappropriate" button and send a personal email directly to the admin (and the post will be reviewed and  removed if deemed necessary). At the bottom of this section, users can share their experiences and choose to include their name, or remain anonymous. Lastly, the user can switch lounges whenever they want by selecting a new lounge at the bottom of the page, or return to the landing page by clicking the "CloudNine" navbar logo.
